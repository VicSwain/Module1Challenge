# Module Challenge 1

## Refactor Starter Code
Code refactored to increase functionality
This project was built to increase knowledge of HTML and CSS, and how to improve on current coding.
Refactoring focused on HTML semantic elements, HTML structure, adding parent and child elements in CSS to reduce code redundcies, and ensuring website meets accesibility standards
I encouter errors with the services images taking up the entire page. This was solved but finding the making the child class for the image. 
I also encounted putting an extra "/" in the CSS by accident which caused a similar issues with the services images. I used the debug to find the "/" and once removing it fixed the issue.
Finally, I had to troubleshoot how to make the nav element match the styling as the previous div element. 
I feel there is very adequate commenting to see what part of the code is refactored, while leaving the extra code as a comment to allow someone to learn just by looking at this.
